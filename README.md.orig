A standard implementation for "The Model" (TM; Dailey and Cottrell (1999)), containing a sample dataset for preprocessing (Gabor Filtering and PCA), and a two-layer neural network for training on face recognition.

<<<<<<< HEAD
To run:

RunExperiment.m - train a network with the SamplePreprocessedData.mat file.
PreprocessDataSet.m - (re)create SamplePreprocessedData.mat file.
Output files:

SamplePreprocessedData.mat - preprocessed dataset of 12 faces, for toy training.
result_face_mono.mat - Final model performance statistics after training.
theta_result_after_face_expert_training.mat - Unit activations, after finishing training.
