Standard_TM
===========

A standard implementation for "The Model" (TM; Dailey and Cottrell (1999)), containing a sample dataset for preprocessing (Gabor Filtering and PCA), and a two-layer neural network for training on face recognition.

To run:
* `RunExperiment.m` - train a network with the SamplePreprocessedData.mat file.
* `PreprocessDataSet.m` - (re)create SamplePreprocessedData.mat file.
